# Data Structure Visualizer
A data structures visualization program.

The data structures are implemented in C++, with a Python wrapper as GUI and Visualizer.

Launch GUI.py, this will open two windows.

One is for choosing the data structure to visualize, and the other window will load a program for the chosen data structure, which produces graphics for the user's input operations.

Currently, only the red black tree has been implemented.
 
 **Dependencies:**
 
  * Add both python and the g++ compiler to your system path.
  
  * Must be Python 3 (3.9 is tested).
  
  * GraphViz library for python is required, install it using:
  
        pip install graphviz
